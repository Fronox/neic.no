The Ratatosk mobility enhancement programme was a NeIC training activity with a
yearly budget of 0.5 million NOK.


### Purpose

The goal of training is to raise competence in staff and end users which leads to more effective and productive work by the Nordic e-infrastructure community. The benefits include more efficient operations and use of resources and an improved capability for the researchers in conducting research.
 
NeIC's interest in training is focused on e-Science and e-infrastructure skills among scientists and e-infrastructure personnel in the Nordic region, for the purpose of raising the quality of the scientific output.
