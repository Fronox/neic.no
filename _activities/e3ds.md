The NeIC EISCAT_3D Technical support EISCAT_3D community on network, computing
and storage challenges.

[EISCAT_3D](https://eiscat3d.se) is an environmental research infrastructure on
the European ESFRI roadmap. It is proposed as an international research
infrastructure using the incoherent scatter technique to study the upper
atmosphere above the Arctic in order to investigate how the Earth's atmosphere
is coupled to space. EISCAT_3D is a multi-static phased array radar system that
will be installed at remote locations in the most Northern parts of the
Scandinavian peninsula. The system will be operated by and be an integral part
of the EISCAT Scientific Association.

The e-infrastructure challenges for EISCAT_3D include finding cost-efficient
state of the art solutions for on-site computing and establishing network
connections between the different sites and with the data archive. The goal of
the NeIC "Supporting EISCAT_3D" (E3DS) project is to support the preparation of
the implementation of EISCAT_3D for those aspects concerning e-infrastructure.
Particular goals also include to develop solutions for locating the data archive
within existing national e-infrastructures and to support EISCAT in planning the
recruitment of e-science experts.
