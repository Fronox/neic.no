## NICEST-2


### Background

NICEST-2 - The second phase of the _Nordic Collaboration on e-Infrastructures for Earth System Modeling_ focused again on strengthening the Nordic position within climate modeling by leveraging, reinforcing and complementing ongoing initiatives. It builds on previous efforts within NICEST (a 3-year NeIC project as of 2017-01) and NordicESM (3-year NordForsk funded project from 2014-12).


Concretely some planned activities include:
1. enhance the performance and optimize and homogenize workflows used, so climate models (like EC-EARTH and NorESM) can be run in an efficient way on future computing resources (like EuroHPC).
2. widen the usage and expertise on evaluating Earth System Models and develop new diagnostic modules for the Nordic region within the ESMValTool
3. create a roadmap for FAIRification of Nordic climate model data


Precursors:
* NICEST (3-year NeIC project as of 2017-01)
* NordicESM (3-year NordForsk funded project from 2014-12)
