NICEST Article
===============================

## Overview
The first CMIP6 data generated by Nordic research groups was published in June this year on the SMHI-NSC ESGF data node (Data publicly available for download: https://esg-dn1.nsc.liu.se/search/cmip6-liu/). <br>

This work is supported by NeIC through the NICEST project. CMIP6 related NICEST project activities include: knowledge sharing and training on preparation of CMIP6 data (including quality assurance of model output and user training on model diagnostics tools) and backing for a Nordic ESGF node administration team. NICEST activities are considered cost-effective way of helping Nordic groups improve the efficiency​​, quality and ​​robustness​​ of ​​the CMIP6 data preparation and data hosting services. <br>

CMIP6: sixth phase of the WCRP (World Climate Research Programme) international programme: for overview and background see references below.
<br>

## Notes
Additional data generated by Nordic institutes (SMHI, Met, DMI, FMI, Uni of Helsinki, Bolin Centre, Lund Uni) will be published as the groups complete more simulations and quality assure the output.

Participation in CMIP6 is a huge committment for research institutes and infrastructure providers. Publication of data on ESGF nodes represents the culmination of many years of work. The steps involved include:
* Model development and testing
* Configuring the model(s) to the CMIP6 protocols
* Model calibration
* Completing simulations
* Quality assurance of the simulation output
* Publication and maintenance of model results

This activity requires coordination/collaboration between research institutes and infrastructure providers - facilitated through NeIC.
