First CMIP6 data, generated in Nordic collaboration, is published
===============================

The first CMIP6 data generated by Nordic research groups was published in June this year on the SMHI-NSC ESGF data node. The data is publicly available for download at [https://esg-dn1.nsc.liu.se/search/cmip6-liu/](https://esg-dn1.nsc.liu.se/search/cmip6-liu/). <br>

[CMIP6](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/wgcm-cmip/wgcm-cmip6) is probably the largest international program for climate change modeling research. Participation in CMIP6 is in general very demanding for research groups, and no single group is big enough or has sufficient resources to complete all the CMIP6 workflow. Collaboration amongst research groups and infrastructure providers is important in order to manage the very demanding workload. This is why NeIC's support, through the NICEST project, has proven to be very valuable. Participating in and contributing to this program is seen as key for Nordic research and for climate change policy. <br> 

CMIP6 related NICEST project activities include knowledge sharing and training on preparation of CMIP6 data, including quality assurance of model output and user training on model diagnostics tools, and backing for a Nordic ESGF node administration team. NICEST activities are considered to be a cost-effective way of helping Nordic groups improve the efficiency​​, quality and ​​robustness​​ of ​​the CMIP6 data preparation and data hosting services. <br>

CMIP6 is the sixth phase of the WCRP (World Climate Research Programme) international programme. For overview and background, see references below.

### Notes
Additional data generated by Nordic institutes (SMHI, Met, DMI, FMI, Uni of Helsinki, Bolin Centre, Lund Uni) will be published as the groups complete more simulations and quality assure the output.

Participation in CMIP6 is a huge committment for research institutes and infrastructure providers. Publication of data on ESGF nodes represents the culmination of many years of work. The steps involved include:
* Model development and testing
* Configuring the model(s) to the CMIP6 protocols
* Model calibration
* Completing simulations
* Quality assurance of the simulation output
* Publication and maintenance of model results<br>

<p>This activity requires coordination/collaboration between research institutes and infrastructure providers - facilitated through NeIC.</p>
