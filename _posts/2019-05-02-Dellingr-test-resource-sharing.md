Dellingr test of a cross-border resource sharing framework
===============================

Following the successful first cross-border resource sharing pilot, the NeIC Dellingr project is pleased to announce a further test of a cross-border resource sharing framework. The aims of this project include the sharing and exchange of Nordic e-Infrastructure Resources and Nordic High Performance Computing (HPC) Collaboration.

Dellingr has a pool of compute time available for smaller projects that need immediate access to a compute resource. HPC computing resources from participating countries have been contributed to this project and are available be matched to and used by researchers. The resources are to be obtained through a dedicated framework found at:

[https://share.neic.no](https://share.neic.no)

Guidance for this application process can be found at:

[https://dellingr.neic.no/apply/](https://dellingr.neic.no/apply/)

The applications will be reviewed and processed by the Dellingr project and the resources assigned with a quick response time from submitting the application.
