## Tryggve D1 - Sensitive Data Archiving

This deliverable aims to support the needs for archiving of sensitive data of participating ELIXIR nodes, as well as for some use cases. The work is targeted towards extending the functionality of the [European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA)](https://ega-archive.org/), in particular to establish a federated EGA with local archive instances - Local EGA (LEGA) instances. The secure software architecture to provide this functionality is also of relevance for establishing stand-alone archiving instances that will not be part of the federated EGA. This deliverable will provide a code-base for archiving of sensitive data that will be convenient for setting up Local EGA, or stand-alone instances for archiving of sensitive data, as well as establish “pilot production” service instances in the member nodes.

### Milestones and results

M1 2017-12 FUSE layer used in pilot production at CSC  
M2 2018-03 Whole core setup demonstrated  
M3 2018-10 REMS integrated for managing access permissions to datasets that are not part of the EGA  
M4 2018-12 Deployment of core functionality code base in a production-like environment demonstrated  
M7 2019-05 At least one sensitive data archiving instance technically ready to join the Federated EGA  
M5 2019-10 Dataset mirroring and/or access between Sensitive Data Archiving instances  
M6 2020-10 Pilot services operational in Nordic Nodes  

_Results:_

Production quality software that enables secure archiving of sensitive data (M4 2018-12)
Pilot production services (as defined above) in at least 3 countries (M6 2020-10)
