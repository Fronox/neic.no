## Tryggve offering for use cases

In a nutshell, the accepted use cases will receive support from the Tryggve project that can include, for example, access to secure data processing environments; technical support from Tryggve; support in legal and ethical questions to make their case happen; and an opportunity to influence future developments as an early adopter. The work support according to jointly prepared implementation plan will be provided free of charge for the use cases. The Tryggve project strives to provide also access to secure data and computing services for free, for a limited time (up to a reasonable amount of disk space and computing resources), although this needs to be confirmed case by case with the project management.
