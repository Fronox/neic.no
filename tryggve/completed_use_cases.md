## Completed Use Cases

### SCALLOP - A TRYGGVE USE CASE ON ANALYSING GENETIC AND MEDICAL DATA

In the scallop use case a cooperative framework between research groups explored what the human genome can tell us about the links between protein levels and illnesses. In June 2016, the consortium joined the Tryggve project, which enabled them to surmount the barriers to sharing of medical data across borders. Tryggve facilitated and developed the access to secure e-Infrastructure for data, which allowed Scallop to host its large-scale biomedical research in a secure environment. One of the key elements to this was to create a system where data can be processed, but never downloaded.

### Schizophrenia

In the schizophrenia use case, national register data was combined with measured genetic risk factors, in order to detect possible causes of this psychotic disorder. The Nordic countries have multiple advantages for population-based research since these countries have universal health care and a long tradition of collecting high-quality comprehensive health care data. This study combines large amount of samples across the Nordic countries and expands upon prior research by combining this data across the four Nordic countries. Phenotypic status and family history of schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders, were extracted from the national health registers which systematically captures diagnoses from inpatient admissions and outpatient specialist treatment contacts. Tryggve and NBIS (National Bioinformatics Infrastructure Sweden) supported the research by enabling the use of the Swedish Mosler system for storing sensitive data.
The findings of this research was published and can be found at [PubMed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28942743)
