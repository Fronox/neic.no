The workshop 'Accessing biodiversity data through web services' focuses on automated ways of retrieving and processing biodiversity data from
public databases. During the workshop, mostly R programming environment is used
and common R-packages and functions are introduced to retrieve publication-quality
(DOI-assigned) species occurrence data from the Global Biodiversity Information
Facility (GBIF). Further we will cover the most important steps of data cleaning
and filtering, including taxonomic filtering to account for the variation of species
name synonyms and misspellings using the package taxise. The tutorial will also
include common approaches to download occurrences of a larger taxonomic
group, such as a family or order. Finally we will cover fancy plotting options to
best display the retrieved biodiversity data, including plotting on interactive
maps.
