Carpentries workshops focus on creating a motivating and engaging environment for learners with no or little digital skills while our three day workshops are the next step.

## Access policy

Note that even though CodeRefinery is a Nordic project, we are interested in giving workshops also outside the Nordics and are able to do so provided that funding for travel and accommodation can be covered.
