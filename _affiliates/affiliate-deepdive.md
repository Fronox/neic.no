## DeepDive

### Recent highlights
Finalizing advisory paper (called [Future Science Brief](https://www.bonusportal.org/news/save_the_date!_7th_emb_forum_big_data_in_marine_science_29_april_2020_brussels.4225.news)) to the European Commision. Remaining activities for the last month include training event on 4. Dec (advanced python for biologists), AI workshop on 9-10 Dec in Gothenburg, and EOSC-Nordic activities with PlutoF.

### About DeepDive
DeepDive is a project for Nordic-Baltic Collaboration on e-Infrastructures for Biodiversity Informatics. Many questions within biodiversity research and nature conservation inherently require easy access to, and combination of, spatio-temporal biodiversity and ecosystem data. The data needs are not restricted to individual countries or areas, but spread wider depending on the temporal or geographical scale of the hypotheses.

Biodiversity informatics is a methodological discipline that helps biodiversity research overcome issues related to the whole value chain of data from data capture to analyses and data products regarding vocabularies, ontologies, digitization of collections, data sharing, data integration, data reliability (fitness for use), data quality, visualization, analysis and long-term archival. The goal of this collaboration is to explore synergies in e-infrastructure development among the Nordic and Baltic countries, and establish common services based on best practice and technical interoperabilty to support biodiversity and ecosystem research.
 
### Affects
DeepDive has initiated the a series of Biodiversity Informatics Training Opportunities. These are smaller courses & workshop in Nordic countries, which are co-financed and co-ordinated with national educational initiatives. Online modules of held DeepDive courses can be found below:
