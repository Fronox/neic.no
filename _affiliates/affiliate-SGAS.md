## SGAS

### Highlights
[Insert highlights here]

### Purpose
SGAS stands for Swedish Grid Accounting System. It is a grid accounting system used to keep track of resource usage (compute and storage) on computing grids.

As the name suggests, it was originally developed in Sweden for the needs of the national Swedish grid initiative SweGrid, but has been maintained by NeIC since October 2013. Today it is used by the NeIC NT1 project as well as a few national grid initiatives across the nordic countries.
