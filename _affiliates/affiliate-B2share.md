## B2Share Nordic

### Purpose
B2Share is a service developed by EUDAT for researchers who want to long-term store and share research data. The service is especially suited for open science where research is taking place in collaborative networks and datasets are publicly published.
 
### Outcome
This project contributed to the e-infrastructure of Nordic research by developing a cross-boundary service for research dataset and associated metadata storage and sharing. The project engaged with Nordic research communities to discuss their requirements for small research data storage, and co-designs B2share metadata extensions and a premium version that meet the specific needs of the communities.

The project provided Nordic research communities with the foundations for a new storage service that enable them to store and share research data with their colleagues, strengthen the weight of the Nordic players within research communities and EUDAT, and foster collaboration, at Nordic level, of national research groups and service providers. The B2Share service aimed to tackle the issue of loss of research data by building a service for long-term data storage with persistent identifiers.
