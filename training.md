## Mobility Enhancement cut-off dates

### Course Mobility
This is an announcement for  [open call for course mobility proposals](/training/course-mobility). NeICâ€™s [Ratatosk](/ratatosk) mobility enhancement programme is a framework for transferring courses, extend and/or supplement national training efforts (even across national borders) in a Nordic context.

The main target group are presenters (teachers, trainers and instructors) who want to open up their courses to a Nordic audience.

The application process is stalled for now as we have reached the budget. For the next round, feel free to check out this page occasionally.


### Travel Grants
You can apply for a [travel grant](/training/travel-grant) offered by the NeIC [Ratatosk](/ratatosk) Mobility Enhancement Programme - the grant will provide or supply travel funding for staff and end users (researchers) of the Nordic e-infrastructure community who can benefit from access to training programs offered in other Nordic countries. **This only applies for trainings taking place in the next fiscal year including workshops taking place in December 2018 and onwards**.

For the next round, feel free to check out this page occasionally.
