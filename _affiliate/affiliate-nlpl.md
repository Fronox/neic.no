## Nordic Language Prosessing Laboratory

The Nordic Language Processing Laboratory (NLPL) is a collaboration of university research groups in Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Northern Europe. Our vision is to implement a virtual laboratory for large-scale NLP research by (a) creating new ways to enable data- and compute-intensive Natural Language Processing research by implementing a common software, data and service stack in multiple Nordic HPC centres, (b) by pooling competencies within the user community and among expert support teams, and (c) by enabling internationally competitive, data-intensive research and experimentation on a scale that would be difficult to sustain on commodity computing resources.
